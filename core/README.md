# core

C implementation of the drone survivability layer: GNSS spoofing detection, lost-link
mitigation, autonomous failover decisions, and operator-link encryption. Runs on the
companion computer and talks to the flight controller over MAVLink.

## Layout

```
core/
  include/core/      public headers, one subdir per module
    mavlink/          MAVLink helper functions / connection handling (shared by all modules)
    nav/              GNSS spoofing detection
    link/             lost-link detection and failover
    autonomy/         decision layer consuming trust scores from nav/link/hardware
    crypto/           operator<->drone link encryption/signing
    common/           shared types (e.g. trust score struct) and utilities
  src/                implementation, mirrors include/core/
  third_party/        vendored deps (MAVLink C headers, see third_party/README.md)
  tests/              unit tests
  sitl/               SITL spoof/jam injection scripts and scenario configs
```

## Build

```
git submodule update --init --recursive   # first time, pulls in MAVLink headers
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

`mavlink/` and `common/` are implemented (connection handling, telemetry decode, send
helpers, shared trust-score struct — see `include/core/mavlink/mavlink.h` for the public
API). `nav/`, `link/`, `autonomy/`, `crypto/` are still empty, scoped to their own issues.

## Dashboard

The operator dashboard is a separate project/framework and lives outside `core/`
(see `../dashboard`). It consumes trust scores and telemetry published by this
codebase over MAVLink; it does not share a build system with it.
